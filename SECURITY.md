2. **Provide Details**: In your report, please include a detailed description of the vulnerability, including the affected versions, a step-by-step explanation of how to reproduce the issue, and any relevant technical details. The more information you provide, the easier it will be for us to understand and address the vulnerability.

3. **Proof of Concept**: If possible, include a proof-of-concept or a demonstration that showcases the vulnerability. This will assist us in understanding the issue more effectively.

6. **Response Time**: Our security team will acknowledge your report within 24-48 hours and provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability. We will strive to keep you informed about our progress throughout the resolution process.

7. **Resolution and Disclosure**: Once we have verified and mitigated the vulnerability, we will take appropriate measures, such as releasing a security patch, providing a workaround, or implementing fixes. We aim to address the vulnerability in a timely manner and will notify you when the fix is available. We appreciate your patience during this process.

We kindly request that you refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until we have had sufficient time to investigate and address it.
